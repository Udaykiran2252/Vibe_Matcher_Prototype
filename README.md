## Project Overview
This project is a prototype of a **"Vibe Matcher"** — a mini recommendation system that matches fashion products based on a *vibe query* such as _"energetic urban chic"_.

It demonstrates how an AI system can understand descriptive language, convert it into vector embeddings, and recommend the most relevant items using cosine similarity.  

For safety and demonstration purposes, this version uses **mock embeddings** (synthetic vectors) instead of real API calls — ensuring complete privacy and no dependency on API keys.
